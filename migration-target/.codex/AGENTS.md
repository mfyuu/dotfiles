- When specifications are ambiguous or information is insufficient and requires user judgment, use the `AskUserQuestion Tool`.
- Always resolve any type errors and linting errors displayed in the console.
- Avoid using `any`.
- Minimize the use of type casting with `as`.
- Prefer non-destructive operations over destructive ones when working with arrays and objects.
- Use `const` instead of `let` as a general rule, since `let` can lead to unnecessary reassignment.
- Check package.json, find and run commands for linting and type error detection, and ensure there are no errors.
  - In many cases, type detection is `typecheck`, and linting is `lint` or `lint-types`.
  - If both `lint` and `lint-types` exist, please run only `lint-types`.
- Never consider a task complete until all diagnostic errors are resolved.
- When creating a pull request, please check if there is a PR template in the repository and follow it if available.
